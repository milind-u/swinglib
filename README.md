## Example
The [example UI](Example.java) demonstrates typical usage of swinglib.

In less than 45 lines of code, it looks like this:

## Setup
- Download the swinglib code from github by clicking on the top right, `Code` &rarr; `Download ZIP`
- Extract the zip file into a folder called swinglib
- Put the swinglib folder in your source code folder
  - Ex. if you had a project folder `my_project`, this would be located in `my_project/swinglib`
- Create a `Screen` class that extends `AbstractScreen` just like in the [example](Example.java) 
- Create a `Runner` class with a `main` that creates and runs the `Screen`, just like the main in the [example](Example.java)
